My name is Ethan Cooke. I am a developer in test. 
I test software because people deserve to use quality built software that makes their lives easier and enjoyable. I test so that others do not have to feel the pain and anger of using sub par software.

Quote I test by: "Comparing the invisible to the ambiguous, so as to avoid the unthinkable happening to the anonymous." James Bach

This blog will contain posts on the subject of development and testing. I'll also be keeping a list of [recommendations](/recommendations) on software, hardware and services. Additionally I'll share some of my hobbies that are not software related.

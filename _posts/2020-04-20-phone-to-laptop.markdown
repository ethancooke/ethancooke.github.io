*Side note, this blog recently became 1 year old. Yikes I didn't contribute much to it, but not too late to restart/continue.*

*Also if you read this line, I am not done writing the article below, just wanted to post for the sake of it.*

So for a while now I have been thinking of moving away from using my phone so much. I am also trying to degoogle my life (might write about the attempts so far). Right now we are living through COVID-19. So I am at home and finding myself still surfing the web and using my phone to perform many tasks when I have multiple desktops/laptops in the house where I could be using a more secure, better performing computer with a bigger screen, better keyboard etc. It's a habit I am sure many of us have at this point in our lives. Modern phones and their apps are convenient and designed to be addictive.

I got this idea of transitioning from using my phone most of the time I surf the web in my house and even when on the go (the on the go part will be extra difficult).

Here are a few considerations:
* *Device* : Small (13" or less) LTE enabled laptop/tablet
  * I'd prefer if it was Linux compatible but it makes things more complicated
* *Apps* : Replace them with websites (a lot of the apps you would use have desktop websites)
  * So far I have been bookmarking the websites of the apps I use on my phone and will test out parity
  * Some apps I already have an idea of not having quality parity such as video streaming services due to DRM
  * Thinking of developing an app that takes bookmarks and places them in a GUI similar to an android home screen
* *Phone/SMS* : Have not looked into Phone Calls or SMS yet, but I do figure I'll never full have no phone
  * I don't call that often and try to tell people to message me over telegram instead
  * My final solution would need SMS for two factor authentication

Notes about this blogging experience or lack there of.

I'll return to this in the near future to update

This will be the first proper post for my upcoming blog. This blog will be running on jekyll and hosted on github pages. I have a background using WordPress for blogging but overall I have never enjoyed the experience of WordPress. WordPress has always felt too heavy and bloated. My needs are fairly simple at this point. Jekyll with github pages is what I have been looking for and it just passed under my radar recently. I've wanted to have a website/blog that is automatically up to date with a simple *git push* command and here it is. 

Also curious if keeping a blog hosted on github will make my github account look more active, but also actually keep me more involved in my coding projects.

To be seen is how this blog survives when I try to introduce media such as photos, audio (potentially podcast) and videos (since I don't want). I might look toward AWS S3 buckets to support that path.

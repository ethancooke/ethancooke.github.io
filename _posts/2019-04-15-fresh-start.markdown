This will be the first proper post for my upcoming blog. This blog will be running on jekyll and hosted on github pages. I have a background using WordPress for blogging but overall I have never enjoyed the experience of WordPress. WordPress has always felt too heavy and bloated. My needs are fairly simple at this point. Jekyll with github pages is what I have been looking for and it just passed under my radar recently. I've wanted to have a website/blog that is automatically up to date with a simple *git push* command and here it is. 

So far my work flow has been to use git via CLI and to then run `code .` to launch Visual Studio Code as my IDE/Text Editor to modify `.markdown` files. Most of the time I work on my laptop so I only need to run commands such as `git add .`, `git commit -m ""`, and `git push`. Sometimes I like to switch to my desktop so that includes a simple `git pull` to get up to date on the state of this blog. I find it really simple.

Also curious if keeping a blog hosted on github will make my github account look more active, but also actually keeping me more involved in my coding projects. The main two focuses for my personal github projects are learning python using my [Battlefield Simulator](https://github.com/ethancooke/PyFantasyBattlefieldSim) codebase and writing this [blog](http:tstr.icu).

To be seen is how this blog survives as Jekyll when I try to introduce media such as photos, audio (potentially podcast) and videos. I might look toward AWS S3 buckets to support that path of hosting larger files.

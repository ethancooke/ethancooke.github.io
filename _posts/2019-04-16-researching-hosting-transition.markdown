So I currently use [namecheap][namecheap] for my domain registration and hosting.
This isn't my first hosting service, I've use many other shared hosting services in the past.

**Problem**: 
* Honestly it is mainly cost, but also I am not a huge fan of [cpanel][cPanel] that comes with a lot of shared hosting. 
* I'd also like to keep my AWS skills sharp.
* I need a solution to host various email address accounts.
* I need a few static pages to be hosted

**Solutions**: 
* First is this github pages hosting using jekyll
* Second is partially [protonmail][protonmail] for my emails I also ported an email to [namecheap's][namecheap] email service.
* Third will be to use AWS S3 for static pages and media
* May look into a home server to host non critical content.

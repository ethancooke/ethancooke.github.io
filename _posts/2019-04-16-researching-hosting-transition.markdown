So I currently use [namecheap][namecheap] for my domain registration and hosting.
This isn't my first hosting service, I've use many other shared hosting services in the past.

**Problem**: 
* Honestly it is mainly cost, but also I am not a huge fan of [cpanel][cPanel] that comes with a lot of shared hosting. 
* I'd also like to keep my AWS skills sharp.
* I need a solution to host various email address accounts.
* I need a few static pages to be hosted

**Solutions**: 
* First is this github pages hosting using jekyll
* Second is partially [protonmail][protonmail] for my emails I also ported an email to [namecheap's][namecheap] email service.
* Third will be to use AWS S3 for static pages and media
* May look into a home server to host non critical content.

**Update 29/06/2020**
* As I mentioned above in the problem section, cost was a factor at the time, I didn't feel like I fully utilized the services provided for the money I spent.
* Additionally on the topic of cost, I am considering Linode as an alternative to AWS for hosting
* Only thing preventing me from using Linode is that I want to keep my AWS skills sharp as AWS is what I use for work
* So all of my solutions have worked for me so far this past year. I did end up getting a home server using [nextcloud][nextcloud] to host the audio, photos and hopefully video going forward

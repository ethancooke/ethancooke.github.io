So I currently use namecheap for my domain registaration and hosting.
This isn't my first hosting service, I've use many other shared hosting services in the past.

**Problem**: 
* Honestly it is mainly cost, but also I am not a huge fan of cpanel that comes with a lot of shared hosting. 
* I'd also like to keep my AWS skills sharp.
* I need a solution to host various email address accounts.
* I need a few static pages to be hosted

**Solutions**: 
* First is this github pages hosting using jekyll
* Second is partially protonmail for my emails
* Third will be to use AWS S3 for static pages and media

I had a shower thought about my career this morning (my head has been in the career space a lot recently). What if when you find a job posting you like and are ready to apply for it. Take a moment and write up / imagine your resume as it would probably be after your first year of working at this new job. Write down your new title, the skills used, the projects worked on, the achievements accomplished. A lot of this data may be pulled directly from the job posting, but really focus in on your specific skill set, personality and goals that relate to this job. How will they mesh to create a unique new resume you will be proud of and have confidence when it is time to move on once again.

I believe the origin of this thought started with wanting to keep my Linked In profile up to date as I progress through this new journey. I am very happy with all of the knowledge I have gained so far through the on boarding process and from interacting with talented individuals. This idea came from me trying to foresee how this first year will roll out. I have many ideas of what I'd like to accomplish and how I will provide value back to my new employer.

For context this view point comes during a time of career change. This is a time of uncertainty. Leaving a job is tough, as it rips away the comfort that one has grown accustomed to. Joining a new company has additional concerns. In the early months you want to make sure to prove yourself (you may experience imposter syndrome). This is also a time that you need to socialize correctly and make genuine connections. In the later months/years concern and focus may move towards the company and its sustainability. The software development market is ever changing and skills must be kept fresh and relevant.

Short example using knowledge I have so far of how this job will go:

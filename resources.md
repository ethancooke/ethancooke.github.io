## Videos
I highly recommend videos for learning about being a Tester. For me the voice and physical emotions expressed by the speakers really motivates me in this format.

Here is my first proper video I watched on the topic of Software Testing that changed the course of my career. Please take the time reduce the distractions around you and listen up.
[Open Lecture by James Bach on Software Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILkT_HV9DVU)

The role of the tester has been in question of its importance and relavence. I found this to be a good video on the topic: [The Future of the Testing Role - James Bach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5821YeWico) {% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId %}

A lot of testers are talking about 'Test Automation'. In the school of testing I follow we might call this 'Automated "Checking"' or 'Tool Supported Testing'. Check this out: [Examples of Tool-Supported Testing with James Bach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWTzgS0aoP8)

## Books
Here are some archaic formatted education tools. Books my not be as popular for the new generation of Testers, but sometimes I like to slow down and physically have a textbook in hand. If the book has exercises to follow, I like that it doesn't take up screen real estate while working on it.

Here are books by [Pragmatic Programmers](https://pragprog.com) that I had read and can recommend:
* [Explore It!](https://pragprog.com/book/ehxta/explore-it)
* [Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java 8 with JUnit](https://pragprog.com/book/utj2/pragmatic-unit-testing-in-java-8-with-junit)
* [The Way of the Web Tester](https://pragprog.com/book/jrtest/the-way-of-the-web-tester)
* [Test-Driving JavaScript Applications](https://pragprog.com/book/vsjavas/test-driving-javascript-applications)

This book is geared towards developers but I also found it useful for my career. It inspired me to right this blog. I listened to the audio book so that is what I will link here. It is narrated by the writer John Sonmez. [The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide](https://www.audible.ca/pd/The-Complete-Software-Developers-Career-Guide-Audiobook/B078J2DZJK)

## Avoid
During my journey I was looking to ways to up my credentials as a tester and I stumbled upon the [ISTQB](https://www.istqb.org/). Their website looks nice and displays a suggested career path with additional certificates. I'd like to turn you away from this organization. Some companies might recognize their certificate, but currently from what I have seen, those I know with the certificate came from large pools of testers doing low pay regression testing (think of outsourced workforce).
